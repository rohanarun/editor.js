# editor.js
A drop-in javascript library that adds AI and visual editors to any website or tool. 

Press the Alt key after loading this open source javascript to open AI prompt and visual code editors and add features to any website(Claude 3.7 ) . It stores the keys locally in your browser.

We use this to add a visual + prompt editor to any toy.new output without installing anything, allowing editing on the open web. Remove the library when you want to publish, use it to quickly iterate, or keep it to allow edits. 


Try it by pressing the Alt key on this website to add any features: https://cheatlayer.com/atlas/sbm7xoffo1_1749100880993.html
